                                Occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. Many people worry about things such as

                                worry or fear. For people with an anxiety disorder, the anxiety does not go away and
                                can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as
                                job performance, schoolwork, and relationships.

                                schizophrenia can make it difficult to participate in usual, everyday activities, but
                                effective treatments are available. Many people who receive treatment can engage in
